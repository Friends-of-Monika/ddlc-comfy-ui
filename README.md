2. Extract it to the `game` subdirectory of the DDLC installation directory;

If you haven't backed up the game folder, you still can revert to the original UI theme:
1. Install the `classic` theme;
2. Remove the `comfy_ui.rpy`, `comfy_ui.rpyc`, `zzz_comfy_ui.rpy` and `zzz_comfy_ui.rpyc` from the `game` subdirectory of the DDLC installation directory.



## FAQ
Let's pretend that there's already some questions:

**Q:** Can you change _X_ and _Y_?  
**A:** Sure. Everything in this add-on made in such way, which allows to make any changes literally in seconds.

**Q:** It looks out of place.  
**A:** Well, we're talking about a mod for the game with all those pink things, polka dots, etc., which emphasizes romantic relationships with an anime-styled girl. So, in my humble opinion, there's nothing wrong with this kind of changes.  
Oh, and also Monika in MAS is not some kind of crazy yandere/murderer thing, but she's now much more emotional and... cute?



## Known Bugs
None at the moment.

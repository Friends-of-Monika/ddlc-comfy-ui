## Installation
0. _If you're unfamiliar with this add-on, backup the game installation directory, because some of the stock assets will be replaced_;
1. Download the latest release archive;
2. Extract it to some empty directory;
3. Open the directory with the theme you want (e.g., `classic`, `default`, etc.);
4. Make sure it contains `comfy_ui`, `gui`, `mod_assets` and `zzz_comfy_ui.rpy`;
5. Copy its contents to the `game` subdirectory of the DDLC installation directory;
6. Overwrite _everything_ that gets in the way.



## FAQ
Let's pretend that there's already some questions:

**Q:** Can you change _X_ and _Y_?  
**A:** Sure. Everything in this add-on made in such way, which allows to make any changes literally in seconds.

**Q:** It looks out of place.  
**A:** Well, we're talking about a mod for the game with all those pink things, polka dots, etc., which emphasizes romantic relationships with an anime-styled girl. So, in my humble opinion, there's nothing wrong with this kind of changes.  
Oh, and also Monika in MAS is not some kind of crazy yandere/murderer thing, but she's now much more emotional and... cute?



## Known Bugs
Unfortunately, nothing is perfect in this world.  
Pretty much every bug in this mod exists because the visual appearance of some UI elements cannot be modified without making changes to the original codebase.

So, here's the list of common problems:
* _Extra_ menu looks a bit smudged
* Buttons in the _Appearance_ menus can become misaligned by a few pixels from time to time



## Special Thanks
I'd like to warmly thank and hug:
* Everyone at Team Salvato
* Developers of the Monika After Story mod and its contributors
* My Monika ❤️
* Your Monika
* Every other Monika in the multiverse!

# Monika After Story: Comfy UI
Feeling yourself comfortable with your Monika, but those little pesky jaggies of the user interface are getting in your way of being _completely_ comfortable?  
This add-on aims to fix this problem.

* Um, well... Almost everything in the UI has been softened in some way
* Multiple color schemes

## Installation
0. _If you're unfamiliar with this add-on, backup the game installation directory, because some of the stock assets will be replaced_;
1. Download the latest release archive;
2. Extract it to some empty directory;
3. Open the directory with the theme you want (such as `classic`, `default`, etc.);
4. Make sure it contains `comfy_ui`, `gui`, `mod_assets` and `zzz_comfy_ui.rpy`;
5. Copy its contents to the `game` subdirectory of the DDLC installation directory;
6. Overwrite _everything_ that gets in the way.



## FAQ
Let's pretend that there's already some questions:

**Q:** Can you change _X_ and _Y_?  
**A:** Sure. Everything in this add-on made in such way, that many changes could be done literally in seconds.

**Q:** It looks out of place.  
**A:** Well, we're talking about a mod for the game with all those pink things, polka dots, etc., which emphasizes romantic relationships with anime-styled girl. So, in my humble opinion, there's nothing wrong with this kind of changes.  
Oh, and also Monika in MAS is not some kind of crazy yandere/murderer thing, but she's now much more emotional and... cute?



## Known Bugs
Unfortunately, nothing is perfect in this world.  
Pretty much every bug of this mod exists because not each UI element can be styled without making changes to the original codebase.

So, here's the list of common problems:
* _Extra_ menu border looks a little bit broken/smudged
* Jumping buttons in the _Appearance_ menus
